Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n💬 Chatbots\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n🤖 Agents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.',\n",

A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place.

Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n💬 Chatbots\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n🤖 Agents\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.',\n",

A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place.

This can be done by adding the following line to the settings.yml file:\\nsearch:\\n    formats:\\n        - html\\n        - json\\nYou can make sure that the API is working by issuing a curl request to the API endpoint:\\ncurl -kLX GET --data-urlencode q=\\'langchain\\' -d format=json http://localhost:8888\\nThis should return a JSON object with the results.\\nWrappers#\\nUtility#\\nTo use the wrapper we need to pass the host of the SearxNG instance to the wrapper with:\\n1. the named parameter searx_host when creating the instance.\\n2. exporting the environment variable SEARXNG_HOST.\\nYou can use the wrapper to get results from a SearxNG instance.\\nfrom langchain.utilities import SearxSearchWrapper\\ns = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host=\"http://localhost:8888\")\\ns.run(\"what is a large language model?\")',\n",

Modules can be combined to create more complex applications, or be used individually for simple applications.\\nLLMs: Get predictions from a language model\\nThe most basic building block of LangChain is calling an LLM on some input.\\nLet’s walk through a simple example of how to do this.\\nFor this purpose, let’s pretend we are building a service that generates a company name based on what the company makes.\\nIn order to do this, we first need to import the LLM wrapper.\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nWe can then initialize the wrapper with any arguments.\\nIn this example, we probably want the outputs to be MORE random, so we’ll initialize it with a HIGH temperature.\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\\nWe can now call it on some input!',\n",

We can call the .format method to format it.\\nprint(prompt.format(product=\"colorful socks\"))\\nWhat is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?\\nFor more details, check out the getting started guide for prompts.\\nChains: Combine LLMs and prompts in multi-step workflows\\nUp until now, we’ve worked with the PromptTemplate and LLM primitives by themselves. But of course, a real application is not just one primitive, but rather a combination of them.\\nA chain in LangChain is made up of links, which can be either primitives like LLMs or other chains.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Memory: Add state to chains and agents\\nSo far, all the chains and agents we’ve gone through have been stateless. But often, you may want a chain or agent to have some concept of “memory” so that it may remember information about its previous interactions. The clearest and simple example of this is when designing a chatbot - you want it to remember previous messages so it can use context from that to have a better conversation. This would be a type of “short-term memory”. On the more complex side, you could imagine a chain/agent remembering key pieces of information over time - this would be a form of “long-term memory”. For more concrete ideas on the latter, see this awesome paper.\\nLangChain provides several specially created chains just for this purpose. This notebook walks through using one of those chains (the ConversationChain) with two different types of memory.\\nBy default, the ConversationChain has a simple type of memory that remembers all previous inputs/outputs and adds them to the context that is passed. Let’s take a look at using this chain (setting verbose=True so we can see the prompt).\\nfrom langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\\nconversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\\nconversation.predict(input=\"Hi there!\")\\n> Entering new chain...\\nPrompt after formatting:\\nThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI.

Let’s take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them.

The first type shows how to create a custom LLMChain, but still use an existing agent class to parse the output. The second shows how to create a custom agent class.\\nCustom LLMChain#\\nThe first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly reccomended that you work with the ZeroShotAgent, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one.\\nMost of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an agent_scratchpad input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.\\nTo ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the ZeroShotAgent takes the following arguments:\\ntools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt.\\nprefix: String to put before the list of tools.',\n",

So if that step requires multiple inputs, they need to be parsed from that. Therefor, the currently supported way to do this is write a smaller wrapper function that parses that a string into multiple inputs.\\nFor a concrete example, let’s work on giving an agent access to a multiplication function, which takes as input two integers. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the “Action Input” as a comma separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\\nHere is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.\\ndef multiplier(a, b):\\n    return a * b\\ndef parsing_multiplier(string):\\n    a, b = string.split(\",\")\\n    return multiplier(int(a), int(b))\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\\ntools = [\\n    Tool(\\n        name = \"Multiplier\",\\n        func=parsing_multiplier,\\n        description=\"useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

For example, `1,2` would be the input if you wanted to multiply 1 by 2.\"\\n    )\\n]\\nmrkl = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)',\n",

For this notebook, it is important to understand the distinction we draw between agents and tools. An agent is the LLM powered decision maker that decides which actions to take and in which order. Tools are various instruments (functions) an agent has access to, through which an agent can interact with the outside world. When people generally use agents, they primarily talk about using an agent WITH tools. However, when we talk about serialization of agents, we are talking about the agent by itself. We plan to add support for serializing an agent WITH tools sometime in the future.\\nLet’s start by creating an agent with tools as we normally do:\\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\nLet’s now serialize the agent. To be explicit that we are serializing ONLY the agent, we will call the save_agent method.\\nagent.save_agent(\\'agent.json\\')\\n!cat agent.json\\n{\\n    \"llm_chain\": {\\n        \"memory\": null,\\n        \"verbose\": false,\\n        \"prompt\": {\\n            \"input_variables\": [\\n                \"input\",\\n                \"agent_scratchpad\"\\n            ],\\n            \"output_parser\": null,',\n",

For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.\\nQuery an LLM with the LLMChain#\\nThe LLMChain is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM.\\nTo use the LLMChain, first create a prompt template.\\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\\n)\\nWe can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM.\\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\\n# Run the chain only specifying the input variable.\\nprint(chain.run(\"colorful socks\"))\\nRainbow Socks Co.',\n",

We can do this using sequential chains, which are chains that execute their links in a predefined order. Specifically, we will use the SimpleSequentialChain. This is the simplest type of a sequential chain, where each step has a single input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.\\nIn this tutorial, our sequential chain will:\\nFirst, create a company name for a product. We will reuse the LLMChain we’d previously initialized to create this company name.\\nThen, create a catchphrase for the product. We will initialize a new LLMChain to create this catchphrase, as shown below.\\nsecond_prompt = PromptTemplate(\\n    input_variables=[\"company_name\"],\\n    template=\"Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}\",\\n)',\n",

A subtype of this type of chain is the SimpleSequentialChain, where all subchains have only one input and one output,\\nand the output of one is therefore used as sole input to the next chain.\\nPrompt Selectors#\\nOne thing that we’ve noticed is that the best prompt to use is really dependent on the model you use.\\nSome prompts work really good with some models, but not great with others.\\nOne of our goals is provide good chains that “just work” out of the box.\\nA big part of chains like that is having prompts that “just work”.\\nSo rather than having a default prompt for chains, we are moving towards a paradigm where if a prompt is not explicitly\\nprovided we select one with a PromptSelector. This class takes in the model passed in, and returns a default prompt.\\nThe inner workings of the PromptSelector can look at any aspect of the model - LLM vs ChatModel, OpenAI vs Cohere, GPT3 vs GPT4, etc.\\nDue to this being a newer feature, this may not be implemented for all chains, but this is the direction we are moving.\\nprevious\\nAsync API for Chain\\nnext\\nChains\\n Contents\\n  \\nChains\\nSequential Chain\\nPrompt Selectors\\nBy Harrison Chase\\n    \\n      © Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\\n      \\n  Last updated on Mar 24, 2023.',\n",

Moderation chains are useful for detecting text that could be hateful, violent, etc. This can be useful to apply on both user input, but also on the output of a Language Model. Some API providers, like OpenAI, specifically prohibit you, or your end users, from generating some types of harmful content. To comply with this (and to just generally prevent your application from being harmful) you may often want to append a moderation chain to any LLMChains, in order to make sure any output the LLM generates is not harmful.\\nIf the content passed into the moderation chain is harmful, there is not one best way to handle it, it probably depends on your application. Sometimes you may want to throw an error in the Chain (and have your application handle that). Other times, you may want to return something to the user explaining that the text was harmful. There could even be other ways to handle it!

The interface is based around messages rather than raw text.\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain\\nfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (\\n    ChatPromptTemplate,\\n    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,\\n    AIMessagePromptTemplate,\\n    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,\\n)\\nfrom langchain.schema import (\\n    AIMessage,\\n    HumanMessage,\\n    SystemMessage\\n)\\nchat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\\nYou can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message. The types of messages currently supported in LangChain are AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, and ChatMessage – ChatMessage takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you’ll just be dealing with HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage\\nchat([HumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")])\\nAIMessage(content=\"J\\'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})\\nOpenAI’s chat model supports multiple messages as input. See here for more information. Here is an example of sending a system and user message to the chat model:\\nmessages = [\\n    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),\\n    HumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")\\n]\\nchat(messages)\\nAIMessage(content=\"J\\'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})\\nYou can go one step further and generate completions for multiple sets of messages using generate. This returns an LLMResult with an additional message parameter.\\nbatch_messages = [\\n    [\\n        SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),',\n",

You can build a ChatPromptTemplate from one or more MessagePromptTemplates. You can use ChatPromptTemplate’s format_prompt – this returns a PromptValue, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.\\nFor convience, there is a from_template method exposed on the template.

Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it’s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don’t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I’m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet.
